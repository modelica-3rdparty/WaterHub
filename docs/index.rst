The WaterHub Package is a Modelica package loosely inspired from the Modelica.Fluid library. It is meant to contain building blocks for the modeling of household-level water systems. The building blocks are clustered into categories which are all inter-compatible. The user can use a connection editor such as OpenModelica OMEdit to build his custom water system.
