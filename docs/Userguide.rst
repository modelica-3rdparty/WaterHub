This section will take you through a step-by-step implementation of your first model using the WaterHub building blocks.


Installation
------------

The WaterHub Modelica package can be loaded as any other Modelica library. The Standard Modelica Library (3.2.2, maybe others) shoud be loaded alongside, as some dependencies are still present. You can clone the library from GitHub using

::

  git clone https://github.com/brunohad/WaterHub.git

from the terminal (working directory is the location where you want the repository to be cloned to).
